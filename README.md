1. **Select Video File** - Choose your video file (supports any format Whisper can process)
2. **Choose Output Folder** - Where the SRT file will be saved
3. **Configure Settings** (optional):
   - Select Whisper model (larger = more accurate but slower)
   - Choose language
   - Adjust subtitle formatting rules
   - Enable AI proofreading (requires Anthropic API key)
4. **Click "Start Transcription"** - Watch the progress in real-time
5. **Done!** - Your SRT file is ready to use

## ⚙️ Advanced Features

### Subtitle Formatting Options
- **Max characters per line**: Default 40
- **Max lines per subtitle**: Default 2
- **Minimum characters before split**: Prevents splitting too early in a sentence
- **Minimum subtitle length**: Merges very short subtitles with neighbors

### AI Proofreading
Enable optional AI proofreading to improve transcription accuracy:
1. Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Enable "AI proofreading" in the GUI
3. Enter your API key
4. Claude Sonnet will review and correct the transcription

## 🏗️ Building from Source

To build your own EXE:

```bash
python build_exe.py
```

The compiled EXE will be in the `dist/` folder.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Smart Subtitle Algorithm

The subtitle formatting engine uses several intelligent rules:

1. **Sentence boundary detection** - Splits at natural pause points
2. **Orphan word prevention** - Moves conjunctions/articles to the next line
3. **Character limit enforcement** - Respects maximum line length
4. **Short subtitle merging** - Combines subtitles that are too brief
5. **Word-level timestamps** - Ensures accurate timing throughout

### Architecture

- **GUI Framework**: tkinter with sv-ttk theme
- **Transcription**: OpenAI Whisper
- **AI Proofreading**: Anthropic Claude API
- **Build System**: PyInstaller with custom spec file
- **Auto-Update**: GitHub Releases API with batch script installer

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python 3.11+** (for source installation)
- **OpenAI Whisper** and dependencies
- **GPU (Optional)**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support for faster processing
- **Anthropic API Key (Optional)**: For AI proofreading feature

## 🛠️ Development

### Release Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds:

1. Make code changes and push to `main`
2. Run `./release.sh` to create a new release
3. GitHub Actions automatically builds the EXE
4. EXE is attached to the release
5. Users get notified of the update in-app

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**App won't start:**
- Ensure Python and Whisper are installed: `pip install openai-whisper`
- Check if antivirus is blocking the EXE

**Transcription is slow:**
- Use a smaller model (tiny, base, small)
- Enable GPU acceleration with CUDA-enabled PyTorch

**Out of memory:**
- Use a smaller Whisper model
- Close other applications
- Process shorter video segments

**Update won't install:**
- Run as administrator
- Check internet connection
- Manually download from [Releases](https://github.com/Gerlif/final-whisper/releases)
